#My Project Progress

* I was looking into projects involving the Amazon Echo and Alexa speech recognition. I have written a skill for the Alexa before for the Hackathon so I think I would be able to implement a real feature. I have the necessary hardware so it's just a matter of nailing down what project I want to contribute to.
